This repository contains code for problems 3 and 5 of Assignment 3. Each folder for each particular question has the javascript file corresponding to that question and the index html file that was created as a result of running that file. 
Paste the javascript code and run it in playground babylonjs. For Problem 3, use the MetaQuest3 HMD to view and place the items where the cursor's ray hits the ground. For Problem 5, the results will show up on the side of Babylon JS.
